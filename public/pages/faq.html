	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<h4>I don't feel comfortable about putting in my password.</h4>
	<p>That's not a question.</p>
	<h4>Should I trust this site with my password?</h4>
	<p>Yes.</p>
	<h4>Why?</h4>
	<p>Because the site doesn't store your password. Your password is necessarily sent to the server to get your balances, but it isn't stored there. It's only stored inside your browser.</p>
	<h4>How do I know you're telling the truth?</h4>
	<p>You can look at the source code <a href='https://github.com/nate-parrott/bearbucks'>on Github</a>, but I guess I have no way of proving that's the site that's actually running. Take it for what it is. As fun as it would be to register you for advanced Swahili and switch your meal plan, that's not what we're going to do. Pinky promise.</p>
